## Overview
This is lab 26 assignment. This is my first dive into Django. Should be fun.

## Getting Started

<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
* Python v3.9.5
* Django v4.0.1
* ([Repository](https://github.com/reichertc2/django-snacks)
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log

<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
